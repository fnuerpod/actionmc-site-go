        <h2>What is beta:</h2>
        This is a testing stage prior to pushing major changes to production. There may be new changes here on both the backend and frontend of the site - this is where they are all stress tested to ensure reliability and functionality. <br/><br />
        <strong>Please note that the beta testing stage is volatile, and both safety and security of data cannot be guaranteed. You are signing up to the beta website at your own risk.</strong><br />
        <br />Besides, the only things we actually store are your Discord ID (public information), Minecraft username (public information) and whitelist state.
        <br /><br />
        <h2>Additional Data Collection:</h2>
        As this is a site under beta testing, we may conduct additional data collection at any time. We may collect this information to:
        <ul>
            <li>Gather user interest in specific features.</li>
            <li>Diagnose and resolve errors in the website.</li>
            <li>Contact a user if we require additional information about an error.</li>
        </ul>
        Please note that a developer will NOT ask for any "session tokens"/"session cookies". Anyone who requests such information should be reported directly to the real development team.<br /><br />
        The following is a list of additional information that may be collected:
        <ul>
            <li>IP Address</li>
            <li>User Agent of your Browser</li>
            <li>Pages Accessed on this Site</li>
            <li>Type of Request (GET, POST, HEAD etc.)</li>
        </ul>
        This data may be stored on disk while we work on the site. This will not be the case on the final website.
        <br />
