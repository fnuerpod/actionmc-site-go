# ActionMC Site (Golang)

A rewrite of the ActionMC website in Golang. Should be more efficient and easier to work with in the long run.

# Build Instructions
Nothing beats a good old Makefile:
```
make
```

# Documentation
Documentation can be found in the [Wiki](https://git.dsrt-int.net/actionmc/actionmc-site-go/wiki/Home).
